A simple AI chatbot built with Python and NLTK as part of the IBM Level 1 Build Your Own Chatbot certification. This project demonstrates foundational natural language processing (NLP) skills, including intent recognition and response generation using a JSON-based intent system. The chatbot engages in basic conversations and serves as a portfolio piece for entry-level software development and AI roles.

## Features

- Responds to user inputs with predefined responses based on intent matching.
- Supports basic intent recognition for common conversational topics (e.g., greetings, questions).
- Text-based interface for easy interaction via the console.
- Built with beginner-friendly Python libraries, focusing on NLP fundamentals.
- Lightweight and easy to extend with new intents or features.

## Prerequisites

To run this chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zachariah-mithani/simple-ai-chatbot.git
   cd simple-ai-chatbot

Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

### Run the chatbot:
bashpython chatbot.py

### Interact with the chatbot:

Type your message in the console and press Enter.
The chatbot responds based on intents defined in intents.json.
To exit, type quit or exit.



## Example Interaction
textYou: Hi! How are you?
Chatbot: Hello! I'm doing great, thanks for asking! How about you?
You: What's the weather like?
Chatbot: I don't have real-time weather data, but it's always sunny in my world! ðŸ˜„
You: Tell me a joke
Chatbot: Why did the computer go to art school? Because it wanted to learn how to draw a better "byte"!
Project Structure

chatbot.py: Main script to run the chatbot.
intents.json: Defines intents and responses for the chatbot's conversation logic.
requirements.txt: Lists required Python libraries.
tests/: Contains unit tests for core chatbot functions.
screenshots/: Stores images of the chatbot in action.
README.md: Project documentation.
LICENSE: MIT License file.

## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language (v3.8+).
NLTK: For natural language processing (tokenization, stemming, and intent matching).
JSON: For storing and loading intents and responses in intents.json.
pytest: For unit testing core chatbot functionality.

## Testing
The project includes unit tests to ensure reliable intent matching and response generation. To run the tests:
bashpytest tests/
A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run tests automatically on every push. See .github/workflows/test.yml for details.
Limitations

Handles only basic conversational intents; complex or ambiguous queries may not be recognized.
Limited to text-based console input/output (no GUI or web interface yet).
No external API integration for real-time data (e.g., weather or news).
Responses are static and depend on predefined intents in intents.json.

## Future Improvements

Add a web interface using Flask or Streamlit for broader accessibility.
Integrate an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for dynamic responses.
Implement a machine learning model (e.g., scikit-learn classifier) for improved intent recognition.
Expand intents.json with more conversational topics and synonyms.
Add support for multilingual input using advanced NLP libraries like spaCy.
