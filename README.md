# Simple AI Chatbot
## Overview
This project is a simple AI chatbot developed as part of the IBM Level 1 Build Your Own Chatbot certification. The chatbot is designed to engage in basic conversations, respond to user inputs, and demonstrate fundamental natural language processing capabilities. It uses [Python and a basic rule-based or machine learning approach, e.g., NLTK, spaCy, or a simple intent-based system] to process and respond to user queries.
## Features

Responds to basic user inputs with predefined or dynamically generated responses.
Supports simple intent recognition for common conversation topics.
Easy-to-use interface for text-based interaction.
Built with beginner-friendly tools and libraries.

## Prerequisites
To run this chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/zachariah-mithani/simple-ai-chatbot.git
cd simple-ai-chatbot


### Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


### Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

### Run the chatbot:
python chatbot.py


### Interact with the chatbot:

Type your message in the console and press Enter.
The chatbot will respond based on its trained intents or rules.
To exit, type quit or exit.



## Example interaction:
You: Hello! How are you?
Chatbot: Hi! I'm doing great, thanks for asking! How about you?
You: What's the weather like?
Chatbot: I don't have real-time weather data, but it's always sunny in my world! ðŸ˜„

## Project Structure

chatbot.py: Main script to run the chatbot.
intents.json (if applicable): Contains predefined intents and responses for the chatbot.
requirements.txt: Lists all required Python libraries.
README.md: This file, providing project documentation.

## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.
[Library Name, e.g., NLTK, spaCy, or TensorFlow]: For natural language processing and intent recognition.
[Other tools, if applicable]: Specify any additional frameworks or APIs used.

## Limitations

The chatbot is designed for basic interactions and may not handle complex queries.
Limited to text-based input/output.
No external API integration for real-time data (e.g., weather, news).
